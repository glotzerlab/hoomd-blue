"""Tuners.

`Tuner` operations make changes to the parameters of other operations (or the
simulation state) that adjust the performance of the simulation without changing
the correctness of the outcome. Every new `hoomd.Simulation` object includes a
`ParticleSorter` in its operations by default. `ParticleSorter` rearranges the
order of particles in memory to improve cache-coherency.

This package also defines the `CustomTuner` class and a number of helper
classes. Use these to implement custom tuner operations in Python code.
