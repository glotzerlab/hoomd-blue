\section sec_build_linux_generic_prereq Software Prerequisites

This page assumes that you have a standard terminal window open. Commands to run will
be indicated as below:
\code
 $ echo hello
hello
\endcode
" $ " indicates a shell prompt. As demonstrated above, if you type "echo hello", then you should see the same
output obtained above on the next line: "hello"

\section software_req_install_linux_python Python

First, check if python is already installed
\code
 $ python -V
Python 2.4.4
\endcode
or
\code
 $ python3 -V
Python 3.2.3
\endcode
Make sure that the version is 2.3 or greater. If you get
\code
bash: python: command not found
\endcode
or have a version older than 2.3, you will need to upgrade/install python. 
Note that you will also 
need the python development libraries which some distributions might separate into into
python-devel or some such. The existence of the python development package can be tested
by checking the output of 
\code 
 $ find /usr/include/python* -name Python.h
/usr/include/python2.4/Python.h
\endcode
The output should be the location of the python development files. If you get 
\code
find: /usr/include/python*: No such file or directory
\endcode
or no output, then you do not have the python development libraries installed.

On a compute cluster, Python may be installed in a non-standard location and it may be required to set
your environment variables to point to these paths. Depending on your cluster configuration, this
may be achieved with a command such as
\code
module load python
\endcode
or similar. Please refer to your cluster documentation or administrator for information on how to use
software modules.

If you don't have Python with development headers installed, follow on.

\subsection python-root Installing Python as root
If you have administrative priveleges on your machine, you may simply use your Linux distribution's package
manager to install Python.  The process for installing software/libraries differs from linux distribution to
distribution.  In Gentoo (http://www.gentoo.org/) 
\code
 $ emerge python
\endcode
would install python. Look at your linux distribution's documentation to find how to install
packages on your system (i.e. yum, apt-get, up2date, or another). You may need to "su -" or use sudo to
become root before installing.

\subsection python-source Installing Python from source
If you are not the administrator, you can still install python
locally.

Get the latest python version from http://www.python.org or directly do
\code
 $ wget http://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.3.0/Python-3.3.0.tar.bz2
\endcode
Unpack the python archive in a convenient location (you may delete the
build directory after installation)
\code
 $ tar xvfj Python-3.3.0.tar.bz
\endcode
and build python
\code
 $ cd Python-3.3.0
 $ ./configure --enable-shared --prefix=$HOME/local
 $ make -j 10 install
\endcode
This installs python into the \b local/ subdirectory of your home directory.
The \b -j option tells make to use the CPU cores available in your system for the build process, set
its integer  argument to the number of cores of your system plus two.

\section software_req_install_linux_boost Boost

First, check if boost is already installed
\code
 $ grep BOOST_LIB_VERSION /usr/include/boost/version.hpp
//  BOOST_LIB_VERSION must be defined to be the same as BOOST_VERSION
#define BOOST_LIB_VERSION "1_44"
\endcode
Make sure that the version is 1_44 or newer. If you get
\code
grep: /usr/include/boost/version.hpp: No such file or directory
\endcode
then boost is not installed. You can upgrade/install boost with your distribution's package
manager. You may need to install the boost-static package to get the static libraries if needed by
HOOMD-blue.

If your distribution doesn't have a new enough version of boost, or if it is not provided on your cluster,
you can build it by hand. Building boost is a time consuming process, but not complicated if you follow these instructions.

In order to build boost, you need the development package for bzip. If your
distribution provides the pacakge \b bzip2-devel, install it.
If not, or if your cluster installation does not have provide the bzip2 header
files, you need to install the bzip2 sources.
\code
 $ wget http://www.bzip.org/1.0.6/bzip2-1.0.6.tar.gz
 $ tar xvfz bzip2-1.0.6.tar.bz
 $ cd bzip2-1.0.6
 $ make install PREFIX=$HOME/local
\endcode

Proceed by downloading \b boost_1_52_0.tar.bz2 from http://www.boost.org/ . Extract the tarball and 
configure boost for building with the following commands.
\code
 $ tar -xjf boost_1_52_0.tar.bz2 
 $ cd boost_1_52_0
\endcode

If you have previosly also installed python from source, the Boost installation scripts may not find
it automatically. In this case, you need to inform the build system about the location of your python
installation.
\code
 $ cp tools/build/v2/user-config.jam $HOME
\endcode
Now edit the file \b user-config.jam and add a line 
\code
using python : 3.3 : /home/myuser/local/bin/python3 : /home/myuser/local/include/python3.3m : /home/myuser/local/lib ;
\endcode
at the end of file. Now you can build boost.
\code
 $ ./bootstrap.sh --prefix=$HOME/local
Building Boost.Build engine with toolset gcc... tools/build/v2/engine/bin.linuxx86_64/b2
Detecting Python version... 2.4
...
\endcode

If it reports a different Python version than the one you have requested in
your \b user-config.jam file, just ignore that message.
The build engine should find the correct Python version nevertheless.
Now, run the command
\code
 $ ./b2 install -j 10
\endcode
or, if you have previosly installed the bzip2 sources,
\code
$ ./b2 install -j 10 -s BZIP2_SOURCE=/path/to/bzip2-1.0.6
\endcode
and wait some time for everything to compile. At the end, you should see a
message saying
\code
...updated 963 targets...
\endcode

Boost is now installed.

You can delete the boost_1_52_0 directory now if you wish. It might be worth 
saving for a little while until you have compiled HOOMD-blue and know everything 
is working so that you won't need to go through all the setup steps again. 


Before running cmake or cmake-gui, set the following environment variables to the location where you installed boost:
\code
 $ export BOOST_ROOT=/home/myuser/local
 $ cmake ../src  # or run cmake-gui
 ... continue with build instructions ...
\endcode

\section software_req_install_linux_compiler Compiler

These instructions test for the installation of gcc. Other C++ compilers can be used
if you wish, though compilations with CUDA enabled are only supported with gcc.

Test if g++ is installed.
\code 
 $ g++ --version
 $ g++ (GCC) 4.1.2 (Gentoo 4.1.2)
\endcode
Any version should do. If you get
\code
bash: g++: command not found
\endcode
then you will need to install gcc using your distributions package management system.


\section software_req_install_linux_cmake CMake

It is not very likely that your linux distribution includes CMake by default, 
but check anyways.
\code
 $ cmake --version
cmake version 2.8.7
\endcode
Make sure the version is 2.8.5 or later. If you have an old version or get
\code
bash: cmake: command not found
\endcode
then you will need to upgrade/install CMake. Try your distributions package 
manager first. I.e. in Gentoo
\code
 $ emerge cmake
\endcode

If your distribution does not have a cmake package, 
then you can install it into your home directory by hand. First, download
cmake-2.8.10-Linux-i386.tar.gz from the Downloads section at http://www.cmake.org.
Unpack the tarball to any location you prefer: this example assumes you are installing it to the 
${HOME}/local
\code 
 $ mv  ~/local
 $ cd ~/local
 $ tar -xvzf cmake-2.8.10-Linux-i386.tar.gz
\endcode
Then you need to put the bin directory for cmake into your path. If you use bash for a shell you can do 
this by editing ~/.bashrc. Look for a line with PATH=... and add the cmake directory to the end separated 
by a colon. If you can't find the line, create it like so.
\code
PATH=$PATH:$HOME/local/cmake-2.8.10-Linux-i386/bin
export PATH
\endcode
Restart your bash shell (or open a new one) and try the version check above to test your installation.

\section software_req_install_linux_cuda CUDA

CUDA is not in call cases available through your linux distribution. Gentoo offers a package:
\code
 $ emerge nvidia-cuda-toolkit
\endcode
will install the latest version of the CUDA toolkit and set all environment variables for you.

If your distribution doesn't come with a package, go to http://developer.nvidia.com/object/cuda.html  
and download the latest CUDA toolkit for you architecture and linux distribution. If your distribution isn't listed,
pick one that looks close, it will likely work. To install, simply go to the directory where you downloaded 
the toolkit and run:
\code
 $ bash NVIDIA_CUDA_Toolkit_2.0_rhel5_x86_64.run
\endcode
Note, this example lists a specific file: change the command to match the file that you downloaded. The
file is a self-unpacking and installing script. Just accept the default location if you have root access
to install, or install to ~/CUDA or anywhere else you please. Open up ~/.bashrc in your
favorite text editor and add the following line:
\code
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/cuda/bin
\endcode
Change the paths on these lines if you did not install to the default location.

If you have a CUDA capable graphics card, you will also need the proper graphics driver version. See
the CUDA webpage linked to above for more information.

If you wish, you can download the CUDA SDK from the same website and compile the example files to
test your CUDA installation. The CUDA SDK is not required to compile or run HOOMD-blue, however.

\section software_req_install_linux_git Git

Git is used for version control. You need to install it if you are going to 
work on active development of HOOMD-blue, or if you just want to download and compile the latest and greatest
version.

First, see if you already have git installed.
\code
 $ git --version
git version 1.7.6.1
\endcode
If you get
\code
-bash: git: command not found
\endcode
then you will need to install it with your distrubition's package manager.

\section sec_build_linux_generic_compile Compile hoomd

Now that all of the prerequisite software is installed, you are ready to compile hoomd.

<b>Step 1: Get a copy of the source code</b>
There are two ways to get the source code for HOOMD-blue.  You can download it
(http://codeblue.umich.edu/hoomd-blue/download.html) or you can clone the git repository:
\code
 $ mkdir hoomd
 $ cd hoomd
 $ git clone https://codeblue.umich.edu/git/hoomd-blue code
\endcode
By default, the \em master branch will be checked out. This branch includes new features tested and
validated for the next feature release. Using the command <code>git checkout</code> \em branchname
you can access bugfixes applied to the previous tagged release (\em maint) or experimental features
still under development (\em next).

To access a tagged release, check out the tag (for example 0.11.0):
\code
 $ git checkout v0.11.0
\endcode

You can verify that the tagged release is exactly as it appeared to the developers when it was created if you
have GPG installed.
\code
 $ git cat-file blob 175bf6edfc8ac23c067df1d9bd7b5dd41982be3c | gpg --import
 $ git tag -v v0.11.0
\endcode

<b>Step 2: Compile and install hoomd with makefiles</b>
\code
 $ cd hoomd
 $ mkdir build
 $ cd build
 $ cmake ../code -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/hoomd-install
 $ make install -j10
\endcode
The -j10 option to make allows it to compile many files in parallel. Set the number to the number of CPU cores in your
system plus two.

If your build failes because of a version mismatch between the Boost python module and your python
installation, you can run try to run cmake with an additional hint to your python installation:
\code
 $ cmake ../code -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=$HOME/local/python3.
\endcode
and run \b make again.

Now run
\code
 $ make check -j10
\endcode
to test your build

<b>Step 3: Setup your PATH</b>

Open \c ~/.bash_profile and add the following line to the end
\code
 export PATH=$PATH:${HOME}/hoomd-install/bin
\endcode
assuming that you set CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX to ~/hoomd-install above. If you prefer to install hoomd to a different
location, simply set CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX to the desired directory in the cmake command in step 2.

Either open a new terminal or
\code
 source ~/.bash_profile
\endcode
for the path setting to take effect.

\section sec_build_linux_generic_mpi Compiling with MPI enabled

<b>Preinstalled MPI</b>

If your cluster administrator provides an installation of MPI, you need to figure out if is in your
\b $PATH. If the command
\code
 $ which mpicc
/usr/bin/mpicc
\endcode
succeeds, you're all set. HOOMD-blue should detect your MPI compiler automatically.

If this is not the case, set the MPI_HOME env var (if it isn't set already).
\code
 $ echo ${MPI_HOME}
/home/software/rhel5/openmpi-1.4.2/gcc
\endcode

<b>Compile your own MPI: MVAPICH2</b>

Hoomd-blue supports the use of CUDA enabled MPI libraries. This offers an extra speed-up
of parallel simulations in some cases. This is likely to be true if the GPUs in one node provide
peer-to-peer communication capability. To find out if this is the case, run the \b simpleP2P test from 
the nVidia CUDA SDK.

If you choose to complile your own MPI, you can run it out of your home directory.
MVAPICH 1.8 (and later) supports CUDA integration that enables fast intra-node GPU performance.

\code
 $ tar -xvzf mvapich2-1.9a.tgz
 $ cd mvapich2-1.9a
 $ ./configure --prefix=${HOME}/local --enable-cuda --with-cuda=${CUDA_ROOT} --enable-shared
 $ make
 $ # note: MVAPICH2 doesn't yet support parallel make (-j..) 
 $ make install
\endcode

The following needs to be added to your environment variables in .bash_profile.
\code
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${HOME}/local/lib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}    # if not already there
export MPI_HOME=${HOME}/local 

# configure MPI CUDA settings
export MV2_USE_CUDA=1

# if using nodes without IB adapters
export MV2_USE_SHARED_MEM=1 
export MV2_SMP_SEND_BUF_SIZE=262144
\endcode

<b>Compile your own MPI: OpenMPI</b>

OpenMPI also supports fast CUDA integration, starting with version 1.7 (soon to be officially released).

It can be obtained from the OpenMPI <a href=http://www.open-mpi.org/nightly/trunk/>website</a>.

Build OpenMPI with 

 \code
 $ ./configure --with-cuda=${CUDA_ROOT} --with-cuda-libdir=${CUDA_ROOT}/lib64 --prefix=${HOME}/local --with-hwloc=internal --with-openib=/usr
 $ make install -j6
\endcode

The following needs to be added to your environment variables in .bash_profile.
\code
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${HOME}/local/lib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}    # if not already there
export MPI_HOME=${HOME}/local 
\endcode
Then log out and back in before attempting to build boost (so that it can find MPI).

<b>Build hoomd</b>

Configure and build hoomd as normal (see \ref sec_build_linux_generic_compile). During the cmake step, MPI should
be detected and enabled.
