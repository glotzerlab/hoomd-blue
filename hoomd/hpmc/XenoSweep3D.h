    XenoSweep is an extension of the XenoCollide algorithm. Described in
    arxiv:2104.06829 https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.06829

    We try to find the surface element of the minkowski difference, that will be hit by the origin.
    It works well for polyhedra. As spherical/round shapes do not have a defined surface element
   that we can find, convergence is slow and way less efficient.
