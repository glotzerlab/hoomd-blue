//! Sinusoidal expansion constriction channel geometry
/*!
 * This class defines a channel with a series of expansions and constrictions. Symmetric cosines
 * given by the equations +/-(A cos(x*2*pi*p/Lx) + A + contraction_separation*0.5) are used for the
 * walls. A = expansion_separation-contraction_separation is the amplitude and p is the period of
 * the wall cosine. expansion_separation is the height of the channel at its widest point,
 * contraction_separation is the half height of the channel at its narrowest point. The cosine wall
 * wavelength/frenquency needs to be consumable with the periodic boundary conditions in x,
 * therefore the period p is specified and the wavelength 2*pi*p/Lx is calculated.
 *
 * Below is an example how a cosine channel looks like in a 30x30x30 box with
 * expansion_separation=20, contraction_separation=2, and p=1. The wall cosine period p determines
 * how many repetitions of the geometry are in the simulation cell and there will be p wide
 * sections, centered at the origin of the simulation box.
