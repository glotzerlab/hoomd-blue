\section sec_build_options Build options
Here is a list of all the build options that can be changed by CMake. To changes these settings, cd to your <i>build</i>
directory and run
\code
 $ ccmake .
\endcode
or run cmake-gui and point it to your build directory. After changing an option, press c to configure then press g to
generate. The makefile/IDE project is now updated with the newly selected options.
 - \b BUILD_TESTING - Enables the compilation of unit tests
 - \b CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE - sets the build type (Makefile generation only, XCode and 
 		Visual Studio can change the build type from within their GUIs)
	- \b Debug - Compiles debug information into the library and executables. 
		Enables asserts to check for programming mistakes. HOOMD-blue will run 
		\e very slow if compiled in Debug mode, but problems are easier to
		identify.
	- \b Release - All compiler optimizations are enabled and asserts are removed.
		Recommended for production builds: required for any benchmarking.
 - \b ENABLE_CUDA - Enable compiling of the GPU accelerated computations using CUDA
 	- Requires the CUDA Toolkit to be installed
 - \b ENABLE_DOXYGEN - enables the generation of detailed user and developer documentation
 	- Requires doxygen to be installed
	- Defaults to off if doxygen is older than 1.5.6. You can manually turn it on, but expect doxygen errors
		and possible missing output from the generated documentation.
 - \b ENABLE_OCELOT - compiles hoomd against ocelot instead of the CUDA runtime
 - \b ENABLE_OPENMP - enables the generation of a multi-core capable hoomd using OpenMP. Can only be enabled if your
        compiler supports OpenMP.
 - \b ENABLE_VALGRIND - (Linux only) Runs every unit test through valgrind for hardcore testing/debugging.
 - \b ENABLE_ZLIB - Links hoomd to libz (must be available) and enables direct writing of zlib compressed files from dump.bin
 - \b SINGLE_PRECISION - Controls precision
 	- When set to \b ON, all calculations are performed in single precision.
 	- When set to \b OFF, all calculations are performed in double precision. 
 	- Must be set to \b ON to enable the \b ENABLE_CUDA option (HOOMD-blue has not yet been updated to perform double precision calculations)
 - \b ENABLE_MPI - Enable multi-processor/GPU simulations using MPI
    - Requires an MPI library to be installed
    - When set to \b ON (default if any MPI library is found automatically by CMake), multi-GPU simulations are supported
    - When set to \b OFF, HOOMD always runs in single-GPU mode
 - \b ENABLE_MPI_CUDA - Enable CUDA-aware MPI library support
    - Requires a MPI library w/CUDA support to be installed
    - When set to \b ON (default if a CUDA-aware MPI library is detected), HOOMD-blue will make use of  the capability of the MPI library to accelerate CUDA-buffer transfers
    - When set to \b OFF, standard MPI calls will be used
    \b Warning: Manually setting this feature to ON when the MPI library does not support CUDA may
       result in a crash of HOOMD-blue

There are a few options for controlling the CUDA compilation.
 - \b CUDA_ARCH_LIST - A semicolon separated list of GPU architecture to compile in. Portions of HOOMD are optimized for specific
                       hardware architectures, but those optimizations are only activated when they are compiled in.
                       By default, all known architectures supported by the installed CUDA toolkit are activated in the list.
                       There is no disadvantage to doing so, except perhaps a slightly larger executable size and compile times.
                       The CUDA programming guide contains list of which GPUs are which compute version in Appendix A.
                       Note: while sm_21 is a hardware architecture, nvcc does not treat it differently from sm_20. 21
                       should not be added to CUDA_ARCH_LIST.
 - \b CUDA_BUILD_CUBIN - Enables a display of register usage for each kernel compiled.
 - \b NVCC_FLAGS - Allows additional flags to be passed to nvcc.

The following are advanced variables, and thus will only show when CMake's advanced mode is turned on.
You really shouldn't change these from their defaults unless you really know what you are doing.
 - \b ENABLE_STATIC - Controls the compiling and linking of static libraries
 	- When set to \b ON, \b libhoomd is compiled as a static library and all 
 		other libraries (i.e. boost) are linked statically if possible.
 	- When set to \b OFF, \b libhoomd is compiled as a dynamic library and all
 		other libraries are linked dynamically if possible.
 	- Note 2: \b ENABLE_STATIC defaults OFF and can only be set ON from the command line 
 		and when configuring a clean build directory.
		Example:
 		\code ccmake -D ENABLE_STATIC=ON ../hoomd
 		\endcode

\section sec_build_plugin Building a plugin for HOOMD-blue

There are several methods that can be used to build code that interfaces with hoomd. 

<b>Method 1: Build an executable that uses hoomd as a library</b><br>

First, understand that building an executable linked to hoomd for the purposes of running a simulation is not a 
supported configuration. The developers will not respond to or fix bugs found while using such a setup. There are many
levels of configuration and performance tuning that are handled at the python script level, and the C++ API is mainly
designed to interface with python.

However, there are many cases when building a simple quick test executable is desirable (i.e. to test or debug a new 
feature that does not yet have a python interface). So a simple method to build such executables is provided.

To setup for use:
 -# Compile hoomd normally
 -# <i>'make install'</i> hoomd to a desired location (i.e. your home directory)
 -# Add \c hoomd_install_location/bin to your \c PATH as usual
 -# Add \c `hoomd-config.sh --ldpath to your DYLD / LD library paths (if you compiled with ENABLE_STATIC=off)

Here is a short example program that does nothing except calculate lj pair forces once.

\code
// include hoomd.h to get all of the built in hoomd classes
#include "hoomd/hoomd.h"
using namespace boost;

int main()
    {
    const unsigned int N = 5000;

    boost::shared_ptr<ExecutionConfiguration> exec_conf(new ExecutionConfiguration(ExecutionConfiguration::GPU));

    // create a random particle system to sum forces on
    RandomInitializer rand_init(N, Scalar(0.2), Scalar(0.9), "A");
    shared_ptr<SystemDefinition> sysdef(new SystemDefinition(rand_init, exec_conf));
    shared_ptr<ParticleData> pdata = sysdef->getParticleData();

    shared_ptr<NeighborListBinned> nlist(new NeighborListBinned(sysdef, Scalar(3.0), Scalar(0.8)));

    shared_ptr<PotentialPairLJ> fc1(new PotentialPairLJ(sysdef, nlist));
    fc1->setRcut(0, 0, Scalar(3.0));

    // setup some values for alpha and sigma
    Scalar epsilon = Scalar(1.0);
    Scalar sigma = Scalar(1.2);
    Scalar alpha = Scalar(0.45);
    Scalar lj1 = Scalar(4.0) * epsilon * pow(sigma,Scalar(12.0));
    Scalar lj2 = alpha * Scalar(4.0) * epsilon * pow(sigma,Scalar(6.0));

    // specify the force parameters
    fc1->setParams(0,0,make_scalar2(lj1,lj2));

    // compute the forces
    fc1->compute(0);
    }
\endcode

To compile this sample (or any code written similarly), just run
\code
$ g++ -o test test.cc `hoomd-config.sh --cflags --libs`
\endcode
(obviously, this works on linux and mac only)

<b>Method 2: Write a full-fledged plugin in python only</b><br>

Some plugins can be implemented fully in python, providing high-level code for configuring or running simulations. 

In order to use such a plugin, one must first:
 -# Compile hoomd normally
 -# <i>'make install'</i> hoomd to a desired location (i.e. your home directory)
 -# Add \c hoomd_install_location/bin to your \c PATH as usual

Create a directory to contain the python module for the plugin:
\code
cd hoomd_install_location/lib/hoomd/python-module/hoomd_plugins
mkdir plugin_name
cd plugin_name
touch __init__.py
\endcode

\b Note: It is <i>highly</i> recommended that you develop your plugin in a directory outside hoomd_install_location
and using a revision control software. You wouldn't want to loose the code you've written when hoomd is uninstalled!
In this case, you can just copy the module to the hoomd-plugins directory to install it.
\code
cp -R plugin_name hoomd_install_location/lib/hoomd/python-module/hoomd_plugins
\endcode

Once the plugin is written and installed, it can be used in a hoomd script like so:
\code
from hoomd_script import *
from hoomd_plugins import plugin_name

init.whatever(...)
plugin_name.whatever(...)
\endcode

<b>Method 3: Write a full-fledged plugin with C++ code included</b><br>

For high performance, execution on the GPU, or other reasons, part of a plugin can be written in C++. To write a plugin 
that incorporates such code, 'make install' hoomd as normal. Then copy the
directory hoomd_install_location/share/hoomd/plugin_template_cpp to a new working space and modify it to implement your
plugin. See the README file in that directory for full documentation. Examples of new pair and bond potentials
are available in hoomd_install_location/share/hoomd/plugin_template_evaluators_ext
