"""Integration methods for molecular dynamics.

Integration methods work with `hoomd.md.Integrator` to define the equations
of motion for the system. Each individual method applies the given equations
of motion to a subset of particles.

.. rubric:: Thermostatted methods

Thermostatted methods require usage of a thermostat, see
`hoomd.md.methods.thermostats`.

.. rubric:: Integration methods with constraints

For methods that constrain motion to a manifold see `hoomd.md.methods.rattle`.
