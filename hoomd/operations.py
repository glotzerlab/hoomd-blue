class Operations(Collection):
    """A mutable collection of operations which act on a `Simulation`.

    An `Operations` class instance contains all the operations acting on a
    simulation. These operations are classes that perform various actions on a
    `hoomd.Simulation`. Operations can be added and removed at any point from a
    `hoomd.Operations` instance. The class provides the interface defined by
    `collections.abc.Collection`. Other methods for manipulating instances mimic
    Python objects where possible, but the class is not simply a mutable list or
    set. `Operations` objects manage multiple independent sequences described
    below.

    The types of operations which can be added to an `Operations` object are
    tuners, updaters, integrators, writers, and computes. An `Operations`
    instance can have zero or one integrator and any number of tuners, updaters,
    writers, or computes. To see examples of these types of operations see
    `hoomd.tune` (tuners), `hoomd.update` (updaters), `hoomd.hpmc.integrate` or
    `hoomd.md.Integrator` (integrators), `hoomd.write` (writers), and
    `hoomd.md.compute.ThermodynamicQuantities` (computes).

    A given instance of an operation class can only be added to a single
    `Operations` container. Likewise, a single instance cannot be added to the
    same `Operations` container more than once.

    All `Operations` instances start with a `hoomd.tune.ParticleSorter` instance
    in their ``tuners`` attribute. This increases simulation
    performance. However, users can choose to modify or remove this tuner if
    desired.

    Note:
        An `Operations` object is created by default when a new simulation is
        created.
