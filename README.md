# Population Balance Brownian Dynamics in HOOMD-blue

This is a proof-of-concept code that implements PopBD in HOOMD-blue.
Key additions are the dynamic bonding and on-the-fly autocorrelation (included here as a submodule) functionalities. Please use this as a jumping off point for your own implementation of PopBD!


NOTE: the latest branch is `popbd_cpu`, *not* `master`. You can merge `popbd_cpu` into `master` at your own discretion.

**HOOMD-blue** is a general purpose particle simulation toolkit. It performs
hard particle Monte Carlo simulations of a variety of shape classes, and
molecular dynamics simulations of particles with a range of pair, bond, angle,
and other potentials. **HOOMD-blue** runs fast on NVIDIA GPUs, and can scale
across thousands of nodes. For more information, see the [**HOOMD-blue**
website](https://glotzerlab.engin.umich.edu/hoomd-blue/).

## Installation

**HOOMD-blue** binaries are available in the [glotzerlab-software](https://glotzerlab-software.readthedocs.io)
[Docker](https://hub.docker.com/)/[Singularity](https://www.sylabs.io/) images and for Linux and macOS via the
[hoomd package on conda-forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/hoomd).
See the [Installation Guide](INSTALLING.rst) for instructions on installing
**HOOMD-blue** or compiling from source.

## Job scripts

HOOMD-blue job scripts are Python scripts.  You can control system
initialization, run protocols, analyze simulation data, or develop complex
workflows all with Python code in your job.

Here is a simple example:

```python
import hoomd
from hoomd import md
hoomd.context.initialize()

# Create a 10x10x10 simple cubic lattice of particles with type name A
hoomd.init.create_lattice(unitcell=hoomd.lattice.sc(a=2.0, type_name='A'), n=10)

# Specify Lennard-Jones interactions between particle pairs
nl = md.nlist.cell()
lj = md.pair.lj(r_cut=3.0, nlist=nl)
lj.pair_coeff.set('A', 'A', epsilon=1.0, sigma=1.0)

# Integrate at constant temperature
md.integrate.mode_standard(dt=0.005)
hoomd.md.integrate.langevin(group=hoomd.group.all(), kT=1.2, seed=4)

# Run for 10,000 time steps
hoomd.run(10e3)
```

Save this script as `lj.py` and run it with `python lj.py` (or `singularity
exec software.simg python3 lj.py` if using Singularity containers).
