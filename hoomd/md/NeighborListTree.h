//! Efficient neighbor list build on the CPU using BVH trees
/*!
 * A bounding volume hierarchy (BVH) tree is a binary search tree. It is constructed from
 * axis-aligned bounding boxes (AABBs). The AABB for a node in the tree encloses all child AABBs. A
 * leaf AABB holds multiple particles. The tree is constructed in a balanced way using a heuristic
 * to minimize AABB volume. We build one tree per particle type, and use point AABBs for the
 * particles. The neighbor list is built by traversing down the tree with an AABB that encloses the
 * pairwise cutoff for the particle. Periodic boundaries are treated by translating the query AABB
 * by all possible image vectors, many of which are trivially rejected for not intersecting the root
 * node.
 *
 * Because one tree is built per type, complications can arise if particles change type "on the fly"
 * during a a simulation. At present, there is no signal for the types of particles changing (only
 * the total number of types). Any class directly modifying the types of particles \b must signal
 * this change to NeighborListTree using notifyParticleSort().
 *
 * \ingroup computes
