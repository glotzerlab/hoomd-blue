/// Base class that defines an integrator
/** An Integrator steps the entire simulation forward one time step in time.
    Prior to calling update(timestep), the system is at time step \a timestep.
    After the call to update completes, the system is at \a timestep + 1.

    All integrators have the common property that they add up many forces to get the net force on
    each particle. This task is performed by the base class Integrator. Similarly, all integrators
    share the property that they have a time step, \a deltaT.

    Any number of ForceComputes can be used to specify the net force for use with this integrator.
    They are added through m_forces accessed via getForces. Any number of forces can be added in
    this way.

    All forces added to m_forces are computed independently and then totaled up to calculate the net
    force and energy on each particle. Constraint forces (ForceConstraint) are unique in that they
    need to be computed \b after the net forces is already available. To implement this behavior,
    add constraint forces to m_constraint_forces through getConstraintForces. All constraint forces
    will be computed independently and will be able to read the current unconstrained net force.
    The particles that separate constraint forces interact with should not overlap. Degrees of
    freedom removed via the constraint forces can be totaled up with a call to getNDOFRemoved for
    convenience in derived classes implementing correct counting in getTranslationalDOF() and
    getRotationalDOF().

    Integrators take "ownership" of the particle's accelerations. Any other updater that modifies
    the particles accelerations will produce undefined results. If accelerations are to be modified,
    they must be done through forces, and added to an Integrator via the m_forces std::vector.

    No such ownership is taken of the particle positions and velocities. Other Updaters
    can modify particle positions and velocities as they wish. Those updates will be taken
    into account by the Integrator. It would probably make the most sense to have such updaters
    run BEFORE the Integrator, since an Integrator actually moves the particles to the next time
    step. This is handled correctly by System.
