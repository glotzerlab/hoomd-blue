//! Composite support functor
/*! \tparam SupportFuncA Support function class type for shape A
    \tparam SupportFuncB Support function class type for shape B

    Helper functor that computes the support function of the Minkowski difference B-A from the given
   two support functions. The given support functions are kept in local coords and
   translations/rotations are performed going in and out so that the input *n* and final result are
   in the space frame (where a is at the origin).

    This operation is performed many times in XenoCollide, so this convenience class simplifies the
   calling code from having too many rotations/translations.

    XenoCollide is a generic algorithm for detecting overlaps between two shapes. It operates with
   the support function of each of the two shapes. To enable generic use of this algorithm on a
   variety of shapes, those support functions are passed in as templated functors. Each functor
   might store a reference to data (i.e. polygon verts), but the only public interface that
   XenoCollide will use is to call the operator() on the functor and give it the normal vector n *in
   the **local** coordinates* of that shape. Local coordinates are used to avoid massive memory
   usage needed to store a translated copy of each shape.

    The initial implementation is designed primarily for polygons. Shapes with curved surfaces could
   be used, but they require an additional termination condition that comes with a tolerance. When
   and if such shapes are needed, we can update this function to optionally implement that tolerance
   (via another template parameter).

    The parameters of this class closely follow those of test_overlap_separating_planes, since they
   were found to be a good breakdown of the problem into coordinate systems. Specifically, overlaps
   are checked in a coordinate system where particle *A* is at the origin, and particle *B* is at
   position *ab_t*. Each particle has it's own orientation *qa* and *qb*.

    The recommended way of using this code is to specify the support functor in the same file as the
   shape data (e.g. ShapeConvexPolygon.h). Then include XenoCollide2D.h and call xenocollide_2d
   where needed.

    **Normalization**
    In _Games Programming Gems_, the book normalizes all vectors passed into S. This is unnecessary
   in some circumstances and we avoid it for performance reasons. Support functions that require the
   use of normal n vectors should normalize it when needed.

    This implementation works, but is minimally tested and only on shapes of diameter 1. gjkm_2d()
   is the production code for overlap detection of convex shapes.
