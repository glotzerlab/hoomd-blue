documentation for more information. To summarize, the new API is object oriented, allows HOOMD-blue
to work effectively as a Python package, and provides more hooks for Python code to directly
interface with the simulation.

* Zero-copy data access through numpy and cupy.
* Triggers determine what timesteps operations execute on.
* User-defined operations, triggers, particle filters, variants, and forces.
* Logging subsystem supports array quantities.
* Implicit depletants for 2D shapes in HPMC.
* Harmonically mapped averaging for MD thermodynamic quantities of crystals.
* TWF and OPP pair potentials.
* Tether bond potential.
* Manifold constraints for MD integration methods (using RATTLE) and active forces.
* Document code architecture in ``ARCHITECTURE.md``.

   -  Add new experimental ``jit`` module that uses LLVM to compile and
      execute user provided C++ code at runtime. (CPU only)
   -  Add ``jit.patch.user``: Compute arbitrary patch energy between
      particles in HPMC (CPU only)
   -  Add ``jit.patch.user_union``: Compute arbitrary patch energy
      between rigid unions of points in HPMC (CPU only)
   -  Patch energies operate with implicit depletant and normal HPMC
      integration modes.
   -  ``jit.patch.user_union`` operates efficiently with additive
      contributions to the cutoff.

-  MPCD:

   -  The ``mpcd`` component adds support for simulating hydrodynamics
      using the multiparticle collision dynamics method.

*Beta feature*

-  Node local parallelism (optional, build with ``ENABLE_TBB=on``):

   -  The Intel TBB library is required to enable this feature.
   -  The command line option ``--nthreads`` limits the number of
      threads HOOMD will use. The default is all CPU cores in the
      system.
   -  Only the following methods in HOOMD will take advantage of
      multiple threads:

      -  ``hpmc.update.clusters()``
      -  HPMC integrators with implicit depletants enabled
      -  ``jit.patch.user_union``

Node local parallelism is still under development. It is not enabled in
builds by default and only a few methods utilize multiple threads. In
future versions, additional methods in HOOMD may support multiple
threads.

To ensure future workflow compatibility as future versions enable
threading in more components, explicitly set –nthreads=1.

*Bug fixes*

-  Fixed a problem with periodic boundary conditions and implicit
   depletants when ``depletant_mode=circumsphere``
-  Fixed a rare segmentation fault with ``hpmc.integrate.*_union()`` and
   ``hpmc.integrate.polyhedron``

   properly.
-  ``hpmc_boxmc_ln_volume_acceptance`` is now available for logging.

*Other changes*

-  Eigen is now provided as a submodule. Plugins that use Eigen headers
   need to update include paths.
-  HOOMD now builds with pybind 2.2. Minor changes to source and cmake
   scripts in plugins may be necessary. See the updated example plugin.
-  HOOMD now builds without compiler warnings on modern compilers (gcc6,
   gcc7, clang5, clang6).
-  HOOMD now uses pybind11 for numpy arrays instead of ``num_util``.
-  HOOMD versions v2.3.x will be the last available on the anaconda
   channel ``glotzer``.

HOOMD-blue v2.0 is released under a clean BSD 3-clause license.

*New packages*

-  ``dem`` - simulate faceted shapes with dynamics
-  ``hpmc`` - hard particle Monte Carlo of a variety of shape classes.

*Bug fixes*

   default type.
-  Fixed a bug where integrate.brownian gave the same x,y, and z
   velocity components.
-  Data proxies verify input types and vector lengths.
-  dump.dcd no longer generates excessive metadata traffic on lustre
   file systems

*New features*

-  Distance constraints ``constrain.distance`` - constrain pairs of
   particles to a fixed separation distance
-  Rigid body constraints ``constrain.rigid`` - rigid bodies now have
   central particles, and support MPI and replication
-  Multi-GPU electrostatics ``charge.pppm`` - the long range
   electrostatic forces are now supported in MPI runs
-  ``context.initialize()`` can now be called multiple times - useful in
   jupyter notebooks
-  Manage multiple simulations in a single job script with
   ``SimulationContext`` as a python context manager.
-  ``util.quiet_status() / util.unquiet_status()`` allow users to
   control if line status messages are output.
-  Support executing hoomd in Jupyter (ipython) notebooks. Notice,
   warning, and error messages now show up in the notebook output
   blocks.
-  ``analyze.log`` can now register python callback functions as sources
   for logged quantities.
-  The GSD file format (http://gsd.readthedocs.io) is fully implemented
   in hoomd

   -  ``dump.gsd`` writes GSD trajectories and restart files (use
      ``truncate=true`` for restarts).
   -  ``init.read_gsd`` reads GSD file and initializes the system, and
      can start the simulation from any frame in the GSD file.
   -  ``data.gsd_snapshot`` reads a GSD file into a snapshot which can
      be modified before system initialization with
      ``init.read_snapshot``.
   -  The GSD file format is capable of storing all particle and
      topology data fields in hoomd, either static at frame 0, or
      varying over the course of the trajectory. The number of
      particles, types, bonds, etc. can also vary over the trajectory.

-  ``force.active`` applies an active force (optionally with rotational
   diffusion) to a group of particles
-  ``update.constrain_ellipsoid`` constrains particles to an ellipsoid
-  ``integrate.langevin`` and ``integrate.brownian`` now apply
   rotational noise and damping to anisotropic particles
-  Support dynamically updating groups. ``group.force_update()`` forces
   the group to rebuild according to the original selection criteria.
   For example, this can be used to periodically update a cuboid group
   to include particles only in the specified region.
-  ``pair.reaction_field`` implements a pair force for a screened
   electrostatic interaction of a charge pair in a dielectric medium.
-  ``force.get_energy`` allows querying the potential energy of a
   particle group for a specific force
-  ``init.create_lattice`` initializes particles on a lattice.

   -  ``lattice.unitcell`` provides a generic unit cell definition for
      ``create_lattice``
   -  Convenience functions for common lattices: sq, hex, sc, bcc, fcc.

-  Dump and initialize commands for the GTAR file format
   (http://libgetar.readthedocs.io).

   -  GTAR can store trajectory data in zip, tar, sqlite, or bare
      directories
   -  The current version stores system properties, later versions will
      be able to capture log, metadata, and other output to reduce the
      number of files that a job script produces.

-  ``integrate.npt`` can now apply a constant stress tensor to the
   simulation box.
-  Faceted shapes can now be simulated through the ``dem`` component.

*Changes that require job script modifications*

-  ``context.initialize()`` is now required before any other hoomd
   script command.
-  ``init.reset()`` no longer exists. Use ``context.initialize()`` or
   activate a ``SimulationContext``.
-  Any scripts that relied on undocumented members of the ``globals``
   module will fail. These variables have been moved to the ``context``
   module and members of the currently active ``SimulationContext``.
-  bonds, angles, dihedrals, and impropers no longer use the
   ``set_coeff`` syntax. Use ``bond_coeff.set``, ``angle_coeff.set``,
   ``dihedral_coeff.set``, and ``improper_coeff.set`` instead.
-  ``hoomd_script`` no longer exists, python commands are now spread
   across ``hoomd``, ``hoomd.md``, and other sub packages.
-  ``integrate.\*_rigid()`` no longer exists. Use a standard integrator
   on ``group.rigid_center()``, and define rigid bodies using
   ``constrain.rigid()``
-  All neighbor lists must be explicitly created using ``nlist.\*``, and
   each pair potential must be attached explicitly to a neighbor list. A
   default global neighbor list is no longer created.
-  Moved cgcmm into its own package.
-  Moved eam into the metal package.
-  Integrators now take ``kT`` arguments for temperature instead of
   ``T`` to avoid confusion on the units of temperature.
-  phase defaults to 0 for updaters and analyzers so that restartable
   jobs are more easily enabled by default.
-  ``dump.xml`` (deprecated) requires a particle group, and can dump
   subsets of particles.

*Other changes*

-  CMake minimum version is now 2.8
-  Convert particle type names to ``str`` to allow unicode type name
   input
-  ``__version__`` is now available in the top level package
-  ``boost::iostreams`` is no longer a build dependency
-  ``boost::filesystem`` is no longer a build dependency
-  New concepts page explaining the different styles of neighbor lists
-  Default neighbor list buffer radius is more clearly shown to be
   r_buff = 0.4
-  Memory usage of ``nlist.stencil`` is significantly reduced
-  A C++11 compliant compiler is now required to build HOOMD-blue

*Removed*

-  Removed ``integrate.bdnvt``: use ``integrate.langevin``
-  Removed ``mtk=False`` option from ``integrate.nvt`` - The MTK NVT
   integrator is now the only implementation.
-  Removed ``integrate.\*_rigid()``: rigid body functionality is now
   contained in the standard integration methods
-  Removed the global neighbor list, and thin wrappers to the neighbor
   list in ``nlist``.
-  Removed PDB and MOL2 dump writers.
-  Removed init.create_empty

*Deprecated*

-  Deprecated analyze.msd.
-  Deprecated dump.xml.
-  Deprecated dump.pos.
-  Deprecated init.read_xml.
-  Deprecated init.create_random.
-  Deprecated init.create_random_polymers.

Version 1.0.0 (2014-05-25)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*New features*

-  Support for python 3
-  New NPT integrator capable of flexible coupling schemes
-  Triclinic unit cell support
-  MPI domain decomposition
-  Snapshot save/restore
-  Autotune block sizes at run time
-  Improve performance in small simulation boxes
-  Improve performance with smaller numbers of particles per GPU
-  Full double precision computations on the GPU (compile time option
   must be enabled, binary builds provided on the download page are
   single precision)
-  Tabulated bond potential ``bond.table``
-  Tabulated angle potential ``angle.table``
-  Tabulated dihedral potental ``dihedral.table``
-  ``update.box_resize`` now accepts ``period=None`` to trigger an
   immediate update of the box without creating a periodic updater
-  ``update.box_resize`` now replaces *None* arguments with the current
   box parameters
-  ``init.create_random`` and ``init.create_random_polymers`` can now
   create random configurations in triclinc and 2D boxes
-  ``init.create_empty`` can now create triclinic boxes
-  particle, bond, angle, dihedral, and impropers types can now be named
   in ``init.create_empty``
-  ``system.replicate`` command replicates the simulation box

*Bug fixes*

-  Fixed a bug where init.create_random_polymers failed when lx,ly,lz
   were not equal.
-  Fixed a bug in init.create_random_polymers and init.create_random
   where the separation radius was not accounted for correctly
-  Fixed a bug in bond.\* where random crashes would occur when more
   than one bond type was defined
-  Fixed a bug where dump.dcd did not write the period to the file

*Changes that may require updated job scripts*

-  ``integrate.nph``: A time scale ``tau_p`` for the relaxation of the
   barostat is now required instead of the barostat mass *W* of the
   previous release. The time scale is the relaxation time the barostat
   would have at an average temperature ``T_0 = 1``, and it is related
   to the internally used (Andersen) Barostat mass *W* via
   ``W = d N T_0 tau_p^2``, where *d* is the dimensionsality and *N* the
   number of particles.
-  ``sorter`` and ``nlist`` are now modules, not variables in the
   ``__main__`` namespace.
-  Data proxies function correctly in MPI simulations, but are extremely
   slow. If you use ``init.create_empty``, consider separating the
   generation step out to a single rank short execution that writes an
   XML file for the main run.
-  ``update.box_resize(Lx=...)`` no longer makes cubic box updates,
   instead it will keep the current **Ly** and **Lz**. Use the ``L=...``
   shorthand for cubic box updates.
-  All ``init.*`` commands now take ``data.boxdim`` objects, instead of
   ``hoomd.boxdim`` (or *3-tuples*). We strongly encourage the use of
   explicit argument names for ``data.boxdim()``. In particular, if
   ``hoomd.boxdim(123)`` was previously used to create a cubic box, it
   is now required to use ``data.boxdim(L=123)`` (CORRECT) instead of
   ``data.boxdim(123)`` (INCORRECT), otherwise a box with unit
   dimensions along the y and z axes will be created.
-  ``system.dimensions`` can no longer be set after initialization.
   System dimensions are now set during initialization via the
   ``data.boxdim`` interface. The dimensionality of the system can now
   be queried through ``system.box``.
-  ``system.box`` no longer accepts 3-tuples. It takes ``data.boxdim``
   objects.
-  ``system.dimensions`` no longer exists. Query the dimensionality of
   the system from ``system.box``. Set the dimensionality of the system
   by passing an appropriate ``data.boxdim`` to an ``init`` method.
-  ``init.create_empty`` no longer accepts ``n_*_types``. Instead, it
   now takes a list of strings to name the types.

*Deprecated*

-  Support for G80, G200 GPUs.
-  ``dump.bin`` and ``read.bin``. These will be removed in v1.1 and
   replaced with a new binary format.

*Removed*

-  OpenMP mult-core execution (replaced with MPI domain decomposition)
-  ``tune.find_optimal_block_size`` (replaced by Autotuner)

Version 0.10.0 (2011-12-14)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*New features*

1.  Added *pair.dpdlj* which uses the DPD thermostat and the
    Lennard-Jones potential. In previous versions, this could be
    accomplished by using two pair commands but at the cost of reduced
    performance.
2.  Additional example scripts are now present in the documentation. The
    example scripts are cross-linked to the commands that are used in
    them.
3.  Most dump commands now accept the form:
    *dump.ext(filename=“filename.ext”)* which immediately writes out
    filename.ext.
4.  Added *vis* parameter to dump.xml which enables output options
    commonly used in files written for the purposes of visulization.
    dump.xml also now accepts parameters on the instantiation line.
    Combined with the previous feature, *dump.xml(filename=“file.xml”,
    vis=True)* is now a convenient short hand for what was previously

    .. code::

       xml = dump.xml()
       xml.set_params(position = True, mass = True, diameter = True,
                             type = True, bond = True, angle = True,
                             dihedral = True, improper = True, charge = True)
       xml.write(filename="file.xml")

5.  Specify rigid bodies in XML input files
6.  Simulations that contain rigid body constraints applied to groups of
    particles in BDNVT, NVE, NVT, and NPT ensembles.

    -  *integrate.bdnvt_rigid*
    -  *integrate.nve_rigid*
    -  *integrate.nvt_rigid*
    -  *integrate.npt_rigid*

    (*integrate.mode_minimize_rigid_fire*)
8.  Existing commands are now rigid-body aware

    -  update.rescale_temp
    -  update.box_resize
    -  update.enforce2d
    -  update.zero_momentum

9.  NVT integration using the Berendsen thermostat
    (*integrate.berendsen*)
10. Bonds, angles, dihedrals, and impropers can now be created and
    deleted with the python data access API.
11. Attribution clauses added to the HOOMD-blue license.

*Changes that may break existing job scripts*

1. The *wrap* option to *dump.dcd* has been changed to *unwrap_full* and
   its meaning inverted. *dump.dcd* now offers two options for
   unwrapping particles, *unwrap_full* fully unwraps particles into
   their box image and *unwrap_rigid* unwraps particles in rigid bodies
   so that bodies are not broken up across a box boundary.

*Bug/fixes small enhancements*

1.  Fixed a bug where launching hoomd on mac os X 10.5 always resulted
    in a bus error.
2.  Fixed a bug where DCD output restricted to a group saved incorrect
    data.
3.  force.constant may now be applied to a group of particles, not just
    all particles
4.  Added C++ plugin example that demonstrates how to add a pair
    potential in a plugin

    even in a flat portion of the variant
6.  OpenMP builds re-enabled on Mac OS X
7.  Initial state of integrate.nvt and integrate.npt changed to decrease
    oscillations at startup.
8.  Fixed a bug where the polymer generator would fail to initialize
    very long polymers
9.  Fixed a bug where images were passed to python as unsigned ints.
10. Fixed a bug where dump.pdb wrote coordinates in the wrong order.
11. Fixed a rare problem where a file written by dump.xml would not be
    read by init.read_xml due to round-off errors.
12. Increased the number of significant digits written out to dump.xml
    to make them more useful for ad-hoc restart files.
13. Potential energy and pressure computations that slow performance are
    now only performed on those steps where the values are actually
    needed.
14. Fixed a typo in the example C++ plugin
15. Mac build instructions updated to work with the latest version of
    macports
16. Fixed a bug where set_period on any dump was ineffective.
17. print_status_line now handles multiple lines
18. Fixed a bug where using bdnvt tally with per type gammas resulted in
    a race condition.
19. Fix an issue where ENABLE_CUDA=off builds gave nonsense errors when
    –mode=gpu was requested.
20. Fixed a bug where dumpl.xml could produce files that init.xml would
    not read
21. Fixed a typo in the example plugin
22. Fix example that uses hoomd as a library so that it compiles.
23. Update maintainer lines
24. Added message to nlist exclusions that notifies if diameter or body
    exclusions are set.

26. Added bibtex bibliography to the user documentation
27. Converted user documentation examples to use doxygen auto
    cross-referencing ``\example`` commands

   documented, and every coefficient in the documentation is labeled
   with the appropriate unit.
4. *Performance improvements:* Performance has been significantly
   boosted for simulations of medium sized systems (5,000-20,000
   particles). Smaller performance boosts were made to larger runs.
5. *CUDA 3.2 support:* HOOMD-blue is now fully tested and performance
   tuned for use with CUDA 3.2.

Version 0.9.1 (2010-10-08)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Note:* only major changes are listed here.

*New features*

1. *New constraint*: constrain.sphere constrains a group of particles to
   the surface of a sphere
2. *New pair potential/thermostat*: pair.dpd implements the standard DPD
   conservative, random, and dissipative forces
3. *New pair potential*: pair.dpd_conservative applies just the
   conservative DPD potential
4. *New pair potential*: pair.eam implements the Embedded Atom Method
   (EAM) and supports both *alloy* and *FS* type computations.
5. *Faster performance*: Cell list and neighbor list code has been
   rewritten for performance.

   -  In our benchmarks, *performance increases* ranged from *10-50%*
      over HOOMD-blue 0.9.0. Simulations with shorter cutoffs tend to
      attain a higher performance boost than those with longer cutoffs.
   -  We recommended that you *re-tune r_buff* values for optimal
      performance with 0.9.1.
   -  Due to the nature of the changes, *identical runs* may produce
      *different trajectories*.

6. *Removed limitation*: The limit on the number of neighbor list
   exclusions per particle has been removed. Any number of exclusions
   can now be added per particle. Expect reduced performance when adding
   excessive numbers of exclusions.

*Bug/fixes small enhancements*

1.  Pressure computation is now correct when constraints are applied.
2.  Removed missing files from hoomd.h
3.  pair.yukawa is no longer referred to by “gaussian” in the
    documentation
4.  Fermi GPUs are now prioritized over per-Fermi GPUs in systems where
    both are present
5.  HOOMD now compiles against CUDA 3.1
6.  Momentum conservation significantly improved on compute#x hardware
7.  hoomd plugins can now be installed into user specified directories
8.  Setting r_buff=0 no longer triggers exclusion list updates on every
    step
9.  CUDA 2.2 and older are no longer supported
10. Workaround for compiler bug in 3.1 that produces extremely high
    register usage
11. Disabled OpenMP compile checks on Mac OS X
12. Support for compute 2.1 devices (such as the GTX 460)

Version 0.9.0 (2010-05-18)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Note:* only major changes are listed here.

*New features*

1.  *New pair potential*: Shifted LJ potential for particles of varying
    diameters (pair.slj)
2.  *New pair potential*: Tabulated pair potential (pair.table)
3.  *New pair potential*: Yukawa potential (pair.yukawa)
4.  *Update to pair potentials*: Most pair potentials can now accept
    different values of r_cut for different type pairs. The r_cut
    specified in the initial pair.**\* command is now treated as the
    default r_cut, so no changes to scripts are necessary.
5.  *Update to pair potentials*: Default pair coeff values are now
    supported. The parameter alpha for lj now defaults to#0, so there is
    no longer a need to specify it for a majority of simulations.
6.  *Update to pair potentials*: The maximum r_cut needed for the
    neighbor list is now determined at the start of each run(). In
    simulations where r_cut may decrease over time, increased
    performance will result.
7.  *Update to pair potentials*: Pair potentials are now specified via
    template evaluator classes. Adding a new pair potential to hoomd now
    only requires a small amount of additional code.
8.  *Plugin API* : Advanced users/developers can now write, install, and
    use plugins for hoomd without needing to modify core hoomd source
    code
9.  *Particle data access*: User-level hoomd scripts can now directly
    access the particle data. For example, one can change all particles
    in the top half of the box to be type B:

    .. code::

       top = group.cuboid(name="top", zmin=0)
       for p in top:
           p.type = 'B'

    . *All* particle data including position, velocity, type, ‘’et
    cetera’’, can be read and written in this manner. Computed forces
    and energies can also be accessed in a similar way.
10. *New script command*: init.create_empty() can be used in conjunction
    with the particle data access above to completely initialize a
    system within the hoomd script.
11. *New script command*: dump.bin() writes full binary restart files
    with the entire system state, including the internal state of
    integrators.

    -  File output can be gzip compressed (if zlib is available) to save
       space
    -  Output can alternate between two different output files for safe
       crash recovery

12. *New script command*: init.read_bin() reads restart files written by
    dump.bin()
13. *New option*: run() now accepts a quiet option. When True, it
    eliminates the status information printouts that go to stdout.
14. *New example script*: Example 6 demonstrates the use of the particle
    data access routines to initialize a system. It also demonstrates
    how to initialize velocities from a gaussian distribution
15. *New example script*: Example 7 plots the pair.lj potential energy
    and force as evaluated by hoomd. It can trivially be modified to
    plot any potential in hoomd.
16. *New feature*: Two dimensional simulations can now be run in hoomd:
    #259
17. *New pair potential*: Morse potential for particles of varying
    diameters (pair.morse)
18. *New command*: run_upto will run a simulation up to a given time
    step number (handy for breaking long simulations up into many
    independent jobs)
19. *New feature*: HOOMD on the CPU is now accelerated with OpenMP.
20. *New feature*: integrate.mode_minimize_fire performs energy
    minimization using the FIRE algorithm
21. *New feature*: analyze.msd can now accept an xml file specifying the
    initial particle positions (for restarting jobs)
22. *Improved feature*: analyze.imd now supports all IMD commands that
    VMD sends (pause, kill, change trate, etc.)
23. *New feature*: Pair potentials can now be given names, allowing
    multiple potentials of the same type to be logged separately.
    Additionally, potentials that are disabled and not applied to the
    system dynamics can be optionally logged.
24. *Performance improvements*: Simulation performance has been
    increased across the board, but especially when running systems with
    very low particle number densities.
25. *New hardware support*: 0.9.0 and newer support Fermi GPUs
26. *Deprecated hardware support*: 0.9.x might continue run on compute#1
    GPUs but that hardware is no longer officially supported
27. *New script command*: group.tag_list() takes a python list of
    particle tags and creates a group
28. *New script command*: compute.thermo() computes thermodynamic
    properties of a group of particles for logging
29. *New feature*: dump.dcd can now optionally write out only those
    particles that belong to a specified group

*Changes that will break jobs scripts written for 0.8.x*

1. Integration routines have changed significantly to enable new use
   cases. Where scripts previously had commands like:

   .. code::

      integrate.nve(dt=0.005)

   they now need

   .. code::

      all = group.all()
      integrate.mode_standard(dt=0.005)
      integrate.nve(group=all)

   . Integrating only specific groups of particles enables simulations
   to fix certain particles in place or integrate different parts of the
   system at different temperatures, among many other possibilities.
2. sorter.set_params no longer takes the ‘’bin_width’’ argument. It is
   replaced by a new ‘’grid’’ argument, see the documentation for
   details.
3. conserved_quantity is no longer a quantity available for logging.
   Instead log the nvt reservoir energy and compute the total conserved
   quantity in post processing.

*Bug/fixes small enhancements*

1.  Fixed a bug where boost#38 is not found on some machines
2.  dump.xml now has an option to write particle accelerations
3.  Fixed a bug where periods like 1e6 were not accepted by updaters
4.  Fixed a bug where bond.fene forces were calculated incorrectly
    between particles of differing diameters
5.  Fixed a bug where bond.fene energies were computed incorrectly when
    running on the GPU
6.  Fixed a bug where comments in hoomd xml files were not ignored as
    they aught to be: #331
7.  It is now possible to prevent bond exclusions from ever being added
    to the neighbor list: #338
8.  init.create_random_polymers can now generate extremely dense systems
    and will warn the user about large memory usage
9.  variant.linear_interp now accepts a user-defined zero (handy for
    breaking long simulations up into many independent jobs)
10. Improved installation and compilation documentation
11. Integration methods now silently ignore when they are given an empty
    group
12. Fixed a bug where disabling all forces resulted in some forces still
    being applied
13. Integrators now behave in a reasonable way when given empty groups
14. Analyzers now accept a floating point period
15. run() now aborts immediately if limit_hours=0 is specified.
16. Pair potentials that diverge at r=0 will no longer result in invalid
    simulations when the leading coefficients are set to zero.
17. integrate.bdnvt can now tally the energy transferred into/out of the
    “reservoir”, allowing energy conservation to be monitored during bd
    simulation runs.
18. Most potentials now prevent NaN results when computed for
    overlapping particles
19. Stopping a simulation from a callback or time limit no longer
    produces invalid simulations when continued
20. run() commands limited with limit_hours can now be set to only stop
    on given timestep multiples
21. Worked around a compiler bug where pair.morse would crash on Fermi
    GPUs
22. ULF stability improvements for G200 GPUs.

Version 0.8.2 (2009-09-10)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*New features*

1.  Quantities that vary over time can now be specified easily in
    scripts with the variant.linear_interp command.

    performance by 10%
9.  Major changes have been made in the way HOOMD chooses the device on
    which to run (all require CUDA 2.2 or newer)

    -  there are now checks that an appropriate NVIDIA drivers is
       installed
    -  running without any command line options will now correctly
       revert to running on the CPU if no capable GPUs are installed
    -  when no gpu is explicitly specified, the default choice is now
       prioritized to choose the fastest GPU and one that is not
       attached to a display first
    -  new command line option: –ignore-display-gpu will prevent HOOMD
       from executing on any GPU attached to a display
    -  HOOMD now prints out a short description of the GPU(s) it is
       running on
    -  on linux, devices can be set to compute-exclusive mode and HOOMD
       will then automatically choose the first free GPU (see the
       documentation for details)
