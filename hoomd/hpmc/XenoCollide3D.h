    \returns true when the two shapes overlap and false when they are disjoint.

    XenoCollide is a generic algorithm for detecting overlaps between two shapes. It operates with
   the support function of each of the two shapes. To enable generic use of this algorithm on a
   variety of shapes, those support functions are passed in as templated functors. Each functor
   might store a reference to data (i.e. polyhedron verts), but the only public interface that
   XenoCollide will use is to call the operator() on the functor and give it the normal vector n *in
   the **local** coordinates* of that shape. Local coordinates are used to avoid massive memory
   usage needed to store a translated copy of each shape.

    The initial implementation is designed primarily for polygons. Shapes with curved surfaces could
   be used, but they require an additional termination condition that comes with a tolerance. When
   and if such shapes are needed, we can update this function to optionally implement that tolerance
   (via another template parameter).

    The parameters of this class closely follow those of test_overlap_separating_planes, since they
   were found to be a good breakdown of the problem into coordinate systems. Specifically, overlaps
   are checked in a coordinate system where particle *A* is at the origin, and particle *B* is at
   position *ab_t*. Particle A has orientation (1,0,0,0) and particle B has orientation *q*.

    The recommended way of using this code is to specify the support functor in the same file as the
   shape data (e.g. ShapeConvexPolyhedron.h). Then include XenoCollide3D.h and call xenocollide_3d
   where needed.

    **Normalization**
    In _Games Programming Gems_, the book normalizes all vectors passed into S. This is unnecessary
   in some circumstances and we avoid it for performance reasons. Support functions that require the
   use of normal n vectors should normalize it when needed.
