    `hoomd.Simulation` caches the particles selected by
    `hoomd.filter.ParticleFilter` instances to avoid the cost of re-running the
    filter on every time step. The particles selected by a filter will remain
    static until recomputed. This class provides a mechanism to update the
    cached list of particles. For example, periodically update a MD integration
    method's group so that the integration method applies to particles in a
    given region of space.

    Tip:
        To improve performance, use a `hoomd.trigger.Trigger` subclass, to
        update only when there is a known change to the particles that a filter
        would select.

    Note:
        Some actions automatically recompute all filter particles such as adding
        or removing particles to the `hoomd.Simulation.state`.

    Args:
        trigger (hoomd.trigger.Trigger or int):
            A trigger to use for determining when to update particles associated
            with a filter.
        filters (list[hoomd.filter.ParticleFilter]):
            A list of `hoomd.filter.ParticleFilter` instances to update.
