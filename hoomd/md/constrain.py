r"""Constraints.

Constraint forces can constrain particles to be a set distance from each other,
to have some relative orientation, or impose other types of constraint.

The `Rigid` class is special in that only one is allowed in a system and is set
to an `hoomd.md.Integrator` object separately in the
`rigid <hoomd.md.Integrator.rigid>` attribute.

Warning:
    Constraints will be invalidated if two separate constraints apply to the
    same particle.

The degrees of freedom removed from the system by constraints are
accounted for in `hoomd.md.compute.ThermodynamicQuantities`.

class Rigid(Constraint):
    R"""Constrain particles in rigid bodies.

    .. rubric:: Overview

    Rigid bodies are defined by a single central particle and a number of
    constituent particles. All of these are particles in the HOOMD system
    configuration and can interact with other particles via md forces. The
    mass and moment of inertia of the central particle set the full mass and
    moment of inertia of the rigid body (constituent particle mass is ignored).

    The central particle is at the center of mass of the rigid body and the
    orientation quaternion defines the rotation from the body space into the
    simulation box. Body space refers to a rigid body viewed in a particular
    reference frame, namely, in body space, the center of mass of the body is at
    :math:`(0,0,0)` and the moment of inertia is diagonal. You specify the
    constituent particles to `Rigid` for each type of body in body coordinates.
    Then, `Rigid` takes control of those particles, and sets their position and
    orientation in the simulation box relative to the position and orientation
    of the central particle. `Rigid` also transfers forces and torques from
    constituent particles to the central particle. Then, MD integrators can use
    these forces and torques to integrate the equations of motion of the central
    particles (representing the whole rigid body) forward in time.

    .. rubric:: Defining bodies

    `Rigid` accepts one local body definition per body type. The
    type of a body is the particle type of the central particle in that body.
    In this way, each particle of type *R* in the system configuration defines
    a body of type *R*.

    As a convenience, you do not need to create placeholder entries for all of
    the constituent particles in your initial configuration. You only need to
    specify the positions and orientations of all the central particles. When
    you call `create_bodies`, it will create all constituent particles.

    Warning:
        Automatic creation of constituent particles changes particle tags. When
        there are bonds between particles in the initial configuration, or bonds
        connect to constituent particles, include the constituent particles in
        the initial configuration manually.

    When you create the constituent particles manually (i.e. in an input file
    or with snapshots), the central particle of a rigid body must have a lower
    tag than all of its constituent particles. Constituent particles follow in
    monotonically increasing tag order, corresponding to the order they were
    defined in the argument to `Rigid` initialization. The order of central and
    contiguous particles need **not** to be contiguous. Additionally, you must
    set the ``body`` field for each of the particles in the rigid body to the
    tag of the central particle (for both the central and constituent
    particles). Set ``body`` to -1 for particles that do not belong to a rigid
    body (i.e. free bodies).

    .. rubric:: Integrating bodies

    Most integration methods support the integration of rotational degrees of
    freedom. When there are rigid bodies present in the system, do not apply
    integrators to the constituent particles, only the central and non-rigid
    particles.

    Example::

        rigid_centers_and_free_filter = hoomd.filter.Rigid(
            ("center", "free"))
        langevin = hoomd.md.methods.Langevin(
            filter=rigid_centers_and_free_filter, kT=1.0)


    .. rubric:: Thermodynamic quantities of bodies

    HOOMD computes thermodynamic quantities (temperature, kinetic energy,
    etc.) appropriately when there are rigid bodies present in the system.
    When it does so, it ignores all constituent particles and computes the
    translational and rotational energies of the central particles, which
    represent the whole body.

    .. rubric:: Restarting simulations with rigid bodies.

    To restart, use `hoomd.write.GSD` to write restart files. GSD
    stores all of the particle data fields needed to reconstruct the state of
    the system, including the body tag, rotational momentum, and orientation of
    the body. Restarting from a gsd file is equivalent to manual constituent
    particle creation. You still need to specify the same local body space
    environment to `Rigid` as you did in the earlier simulation.

    To set constituent particle types and coordinates for a rigid body use the
    `body` attribute.

    .. py:attribute:: body

        body is a mapping from the central particle type to a body definition
        represented as a dictionary. The mapping respects ``None`` as meaning
        that the type is not a rigid body center. All types are set to ``None``
        by default. The keys for the body definition are

        - ``constituent_types`` (list[str]): List of types of constituent
          particles
        - ``positions`` (list[tuple[float, float, float]]): List of relative
          positions of constituent particles
        - ``orientations`` (list[tuple[float, float, float, float]]): List of
          orientations (as quaternions) of constituent particles
        - ``charge`` (list[float]): List of charges of constituent particles
        - ``diameters`` (list[float]): List of diameters of constituent
          particles

        Type: `TypeParameter` [``particle_type``, `dict`]

    .. caution::
        The constituent particle type must exist.

    Example::

        rigid = constrain.Rigid()
        rigid.body['A'] = {
            "constituent_types": ['A_const', 'A_const'],
            "positions": [(0,0,1),(0,0,-1)],
            "orientations": [(1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0), (1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)],
            "charges": [0.0, 0.0],
            "diameters": [1.0, 1.0]
            }
        rigid.body['B'] = {
            "constituent_types": ['B_const', 'B_const'],
            "positions": [(0,0,.5),(0,0,-.5)],
            "orientations": [(1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0), (1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)],
            "charges": [0.0, 1.0],
            "diameters": [1.5, 1.0]
            }

        # Can set rigid body definition to be None explicitly.
        rigid.body["A"] = None

    Warning:
        `Rigid` will significantly slow down a simulation when
        frequently changing rigid body definitions or adding/removing particles
        from the simulation.
