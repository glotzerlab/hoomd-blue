class BoxMC(Updater):
    r"""Apply box updates to sample isobaric and related ensembles.

    Args:
        betaP (`float` or :py:mod:`hoomd.variant.Variant`):
            :math:`\frac{p}{k_{\mathrm{B}}T}` :math:`[\mathrm{length}^{-2}]`
            in 2D or :math:`[\mathrm{length}^{-3}]` in 3D.
        trigger (hoomd.trigger.Trigger): Select the timesteps to perform box
            trial moves.

    Use `BoxMC` in conjunction with an HPMC integrator to allow the simulation
    box to undergo random fluctuations at constant pressure. `BoxMC` supports
    both isotropic (all box sides changed equally) and anisotropic volume change
    moves as well as shearing of the simulation box. Multiple types of box moves
    can be applied simultaneously during a simulation. For this purpose, each
    type of box move has an associated weight that determines the relative
    frequency of a box move happening relative to the others. By default, no
    moves are applied (*weight* values for all move types default to 0). After
    a box trial move is proposed, all the particle positions are scaled into the
    new box. Trial moves are then accepted, if they do not produce an overlap,
    according to standard Metropolis criterion and rejected otherwise.

    Attributes:
        volume (dict):
            Parameters for isobaric volume moves that scale the box lengths
            uniformly. The dictionary has the following keys:

            * ``weight`` (float) - Relative weight of volume box moves.
            * ``mode`` (str) - ``standard`` proposes changes to the box volume
              and ``ln`` proposes changes to the logarithm of the volume.
              Initially starts off in 'standard' mode.
            * ``delta`` (float) - Maximum change in **V** or **ln(V)** where V
              is box area (2D) or volume (3D).

        aspect (dict):
            Parameters for isovolume aspect ratio moves. The dictionary has the
            following keys:

            * ``weight`` (float) - Relative weight of aspect box moves.
            * ``delta`` (float) - Maximum relative change of box aspect ratio.

        length (dict):
            Parameters for isobaric box length moves that change box lengths
            independently. The dictionary has the following keys:

            * ``weight`` (float) - Maximum change of HOOMD-blue box parameters
              Lx, Ly, and Lz.
            * ``delta`` (tuple[float, float, float]) - Maximum change of the
              box lengths ``(Lx, Ly, Lz)`` :math:`[\mathrm{length}]`.

        shear (dict):
            Parameters for isovolume box shear moves. The dictionary has the
            following keys:

            * ``weight`` (float) - Relative weight of shear box moves.
            * ``delta`` (tuple[float, float, float]) -  maximum change of the
              box tilt factor ``(xy, xz, yz)``.
            * ``reduce`` (float) - Maximum number of lattice vectors of shear
              to allow before applying lattice reduction. Values less than 0.5
              disable shear reduction.

        instance (int):
            When using multiple `BoxMC` updaters in a single simulation,
            give each a unique value for `instance` so they generate
            different streams of random numbers.

    The GCA as described in Liu and Lujten (2004),
    http://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.92.035504 is used for hard shape, patch
    interactions and depletants.

    Implicit depletants are supported and simulated on-the-fly, as if they were
    present in the actual system.

    Supported moves include pivot moves (point reflection) and line reflections
    (pi rotation around an axis).  With anisotropic particles, the pivot move
    cannot be used because it would create a chiral mirror image of the
    particle, and only line reflections are employed. In general, line
    reflections are not rejection free because of periodic boundary conditions,
    as discussed in Sinkovits et al. (2012), http://doi.org/10.1063/1.3694271 .
    However, we restrict the line reflections to axes parallel to the box axis,
    which makes those moves rejection-free for anisotropic particles, but the
    algorithm is then no longer ergodic for those and needs to be combined with
    local moves.

class QuickCompress(Updater):
    """Quickly compress a hard particle system to a target box.

    Args:
        trigger (Trigger): Update the box dimensions on triggered time steps.

        target_box (Box): Dimensions of the target box.

        max_overlaps_per_particle (float): The maximum number of overlaps to
            allow per particle (may be less than 1 - e.g.
            up to 250 overlaps would be allowed when in a system of 1000
            particles when max_overlaps_per_particle=0.25).

        min_scale (float): The minimum scale factor to apply to box dimensions.

    Use `QuickCompress` in conjunction with an HPMC integrator to scale the
    system to a target box size. `QuickCompress` can typically compress dilute
    systems to near random close packing densities in tens of thousands of time
    steps.

    It operates by making small changes toward the `target_box`: ``L_new = scale
    * L_current`` for each box parameter and then scaling the particle positions
    into the new box. If there are more than ``max_overlaps_per_particle *
    N_particles`` hard particle overlaps in the system, the box move is
    rejected. Otherwise, the small number of overlaps remain. `QuickCompress`
    then waits until local MC trial moves provided by the HPMC integrator
    remove all overlaps before it makes another box change.

    Note:
        The target box size may be larger or smaller than the current system
        box, and also may have different tilt factors. When the target box
        parameter is larger than the current, it scales by ``L_new = 1/scale *
        L_current``

    `QuickCompress` adjusts the value of ``scale`` based on the particle and
    translational trial move sizes to ensure that the trial moves will be able
    to remove the overlaps. It chooses a value of ``scale`` randomly between
    ``max(min_scale, 1.0 - min_move_size / max_diameter)`` and 1.0 where
    ``min_move_size`` is the smallest MC translational move size adjusted
    by the acceptance ratio and ``max_diameter`` is the circumsphere diameter
    of the largest particle type.

    Tip:
        Use the `hoomd.hpmc.tune.MoveSizeTuner` in conjunction with
        `QuickCompress` to adjust the move sizes to maintain a constant
        acceptance ratio as the density of the system increases.

    Warning:
        When the smallest MC translational move size is 0, `QuickCompress`
        will scale the box by 1.0 and not progress toward the target box.

    Attributes:
        trigger (Trigger): Update the box dimensions on triggered time steps.

        target_box (Box): Dimensions of the target box.

        max_overlaps_per_particle (float): The maximum number of overlaps to
            allow per particle (may be less than 1 - e.g.
            up to 250 overlaps would be allowed when in a system of 1000
            particles when max_overlaps_per_particle=0.25).

        min_scale (float): The minimum scale factor to apply to box dimensions.

        instance (int):
            When using multiple `QuickCompress` updaters in a single simulation,
            give each a unique value for `instance` so that they generate
            different streams of random numbers.
