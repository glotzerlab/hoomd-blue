\section sec_build_mac_prereq Software Prerequisites

HOOMD-blue requires a number of prerequisite software packages and libraries to be installed before it can be compiled.
Macports (http://www.macports.org) greatly simplifies the installation of these.

This page assumes that you have a standard terminal window open in some cases. Commands to run in the terminal will
be indicated as below:
\code
 $ echo hello
 hello
 \endcode
 " $ " indicates a shell prompt. As demonstrated above, if you type "echo hello", then you should see the same
 output obtained above on the next line: "hello"

<b>1. Install macports</b>
Go to http://www.macports.org and download the appropriate dmg for your system. Mount the dmg by double-clicking on it.
Double-click on the pkg installer for macports and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the install.

If you have not yet installed the Apple developer tools (Xcode) on your system, you will need to do so now. Follow
the instructions in the macports documentation: http://guide.macports.org/

Finally, run macports' selfupdate command to bring your install fully up to date:
\code
 $ sudo port selfupdate
 ...
\endcode

<b>2. Install cmake, boost, and python</b>

With macports, installing cmake, boost, and python is easy. Just run the following command in a terminal.
\code
 $ sudo port install cmake boost +python27 python_select
\endcode
The process can take up to 4 hours, so be patient or leave it to run overnight.

After macports finishes the above command, run
\code
 $ sudo port select python python27
\endcode
to select the python that macports installed. This step is crucial, or else you will get python <i>version mismatch</i>
or <i>'NoneType'</i> errors when trying to run hoomd.

You can switch back to the Apple installed python at any time by running
\code
 $ sudo port select python python26-apple
\endcode
or see a list of all python installations you can switch between with
\code
 $ port select python
\endcode

<b>3. (optional) Install the NVIDIA CUDA toolkit and driver</b>

Download the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit (version 3.0 beta or newer) appropriate for your system from
http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_get.html . To install, open Finder, navigate to the directory where you downloaded
the file and double-click on it. Follow the on screen prompts to complete the installation.
 
If you have an NVIDIA GPU, Download the CUDA drivers for your GPU from http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_get.html .
To install, open Finder, navigate to the directory where you downloaded the file and double-click on it.
Follow the on screen prompts to complete the installation.

<b>4. (optional) Install doxygen</b>

Download the doxygen dmg from http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/ . Mount the dmg by double-clicking on it. Install
by dragging Doxygen to your /Applications directory.

<b>5. (optional) Install git.</b>

Download the git dmg from http://git-scm.com/ and install the software.

\section sec_build_mac_compile Compile hoomd

Now that all of the prerequisite software is installed, you are ready to compile hoomd.

<b>Step 1: Get a copy of the source code</b>
There are two ways to get the source code for HOOMD-blue.  You can download it
(http://codeblue.umich.edu/hoomd-blue/download.html) or you can clone the git repository:
\code
 $ mkdir hoomd
 $ cd hoomd
 $ git clone https://codeblue.umich.edu/git/hoomd-blue code
\endcode
By default, the \em master branch will be checked out. This branch includes new features tested and
validated for the next feature release. Using the command <code>git checkout</code> \em branchname
you can access bugfixes applied to the previous tagged release (\em maint) or experimental features
still under development (\em next).

To access a tagged release, check out the tag (for example 0.10.0):
\code
 $ git checkout v0.10.0
\endcode

You can verify that the tagged release is exactly as it appeared to the developers when it was created if you
have GPG installed.
\code
 $ git cat-file blob 175bf6edfc8ac23c067df1d9bd7b5dd41982be3c | gpg --import
 $ git tag -v v0.10.0
\endcode

<b>Step 2 (option A): Compile and install hoomd with makefiles</b>
\code
 $ cd hoomd
 $ mkdir build
 $ cd build
 $ cmake ../code -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/hoomd-install
 $ make install -j4
\endcode
The -j4 option to make allows it to compile many files in parallel. Set the number to the number of CPU cores in your
system plus two.

Now run
\code
 $ make check -j4
\endcode
to test your build

<b>Step 2 (option B): Compile and install hoomd with Xcode</b>
\code
 $ cd hoomd
 $ mkdir build
 $ cd build
 $ cmake ../code -GXcode -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/hoomd-install
 $ open HOOMD.xcodeproj
\endcode
Press command-B to build hoomd. Build the INSTALL target to install the built hoomd to CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX. 
<b>Note:</b> Xcode defaults to Debug builds!

To run the tests, build the test_all target. Then run the following command in the build/ directory
\code
 $ CONFIGURATION=Debug ctest -CDebug
\endcode
assuming you build the Debug configuration. Change Debug to Release in both locations on the command line to test
a release build.

<b>Step 3: Setup your PATH</b>
\code
 open ~/.bash_profile
\endcode
and add the following line to the end
\code
 export PATH=$PATH:${HOME}/hoomd-install/bin
\endcode
assuming that you set CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX to ~/hoomd-install above. If you prefer to install hoomd to a different
location, simply set CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX to the desired directory in the cmake command in step 2.
