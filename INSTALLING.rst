`Docker <https://hub.docker.com/>`_/`Singularity <https://www.sylabs.io/>`_ images and for Linux and macOS via the
`hoomd package on conda-forge <https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/hoomd>`_.

Singularity / Docker images
---------------------------

See the `glotzerlab-software documentation <https://glotzerlab-software.readthedocs.io/>`_ for container usage
information and cluster specific instructions.

Docker::

    ▶ docker pull glotzerlab/software

.. note::

    See the `glotzerlab-software documentation <https://glotzerlab-software.readthedocs.io/>`_ for cluster specific
    instructions.

Installing with conda
---------------------

**HOOMD-blue** is available on `conda-forge <https://conda-forge.org>`_. To
install, first download and install `miniconda
<https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`_. Then install ``hoomd``
from the ``conda-forge`` channel::

    ▶ conda install -c conda-forge hoomd

A build of HOOMD with support for NVIDIA GPUs is also available from the
``conda-forge`` channel::

    $ conda install -c conda-forge hoomd=*=*gpu*

Compiling from source
=====================

Obtain the source
-----------------

Download source releases directly from the web:
https://glotzerlab.engin.umich.edu/Downloads/hoomd

.. code-block:: bash

   ▶ curl -O https://glotzerlab.engin.umich.edu/Downloads/hoomd/hoomd-v2.9.2.tar.gz

Or clone using Git:

.. code-block:: bash

   ▶ git clone --recursive https://github.com/glotzerlab/hoomd-blue

**HOOMD-blue** uses Git submodules. Either clone with the ``--recursive``
option, or execute ``git submodule update --init`` to fetch the submodules.

Configure a virtual environment
-------------------------------

When using a shared Python installation, create a `virtual environment
<https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html>`_ where you can install
**HOOMD-blue**::

    ▶ python3 -m venv /path/to/environment --system-site-packages

Activate the environment before configuring and before executing
**HOOMD-blue** scripts::

   ▶ source /path/to/environment/bin/activate

Tell CMake to search for packages in the virtual environment first::

    ▶ export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/environment

.. note::

   Other types of virtual environments (such as *conda*) may work, but are not thoroughly tested.

Install prerequisites
---------------------

**HOOMD-blue** requires a number of libraries to build.

- Required:

  - C++11 capable compiler (tested with ``gcc`` 4.8, 5.5, 6.4, 7,
    8, 9, ``clang`` 5, 6, 7, 8)
  - Python >= 3.5
  - NumPy >= 1.7
  - pybind11 >= 2.2
  - Eigen >= 3.2
  - CMake >= 3.9
  - For MPI parallel execution (required when ``ENABLE_MPI=on``):

    - MPI (tested with OpenMPI, MVAPICH)
    - cereal >= 1.1 (required when ``ENABLE_MPI=on``)

  - For GPU execution (required when ``ENABLE_GPU=on``):

    - NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit >= 9.0

    **OR**

    - `AMD ROCm >= 2.9 <https://rocm.github.io/ROCmInstall.html>`_

      Additional dependencies:
        - HIP [with `hipcc` and `hcc` as backend]
        - rocFFT
        - rocPRIM
        - rocThrust
        - hipCUB, included for NVIDIA GPU targets, but required as an
          external dependency when building for AMD GPUs
        - roctracer-dev
        - Linux kernel >= 3.5.0

      For HOOMD-blue on AMD GPUs, the following limitations currently apply.

      1. Certain HOOMD-blue kernels trigger a `unknown HSA error <https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/HIP/issues/1662>`_.
         A `temporary bugfix branch of HIP <https://github.com/glotzerlab/HIP/tree/hipfuncgetattributes_revertvectortypes>`_
         addresses these problems. When using a custom HIP version, other libraries used by HOOMD-blue (`rocfft`) need
         to be compiled against that same HIP version.

      2. The `mpcd` component is disabled on AMD GPUs.

      3. Multi-GPU execution via unified memory is not available.

  - For threaded parallelism on the CPU (required when ``ENABLE_TBB=on``):

    - Intel Threading Building Blocks >= 4.3

  - For runtime code generation (required when ``BUILD_JIT=on``):

    - LLVM >= 5.0

  - To build documentation:

    - Doxygen >= 1.8.5
    - Sphinx >= 1.6

Install these tools with your system or virtual environment package manager. HOOMD developers have had success with
``pacman`` (`arch linux <https://www.archlinux.org/>`_), ``apt-get`` (`ubuntu <https://ubuntu.com/>`_), `Homebrew
<https://brew.sh/>`_ (macOS), and `MacPorts <https://www.macports.org/>`_ (macOS)::

    ▶ your-package-manager install python python-numpy pybind11 eigen cmake openmpi cereal cuda

Typical HPC cluster environments provide python, numpy, cmake, cuda, and mpi, via a module system::

    ▶ module load gcc python cuda cmake

.. note::

    Packages may be named differently, check your system's package list. Install any ``-dev`` packages as needed.

.. tip::

    You can install numpy and other python packages into your virtual environment::

        python3 -m pip install numpy

Some package managers (such as *pip*) and most clusters are missing some or all of pybind11, eigen, and cereal.
``install-prereq-headers.py`` will install the missing packages into your virtual environment::

    ▶ cd /path/to/hoomd-blue
    ▶ python3 install-prereq-headers.py

Run ``python3 install-prereq-headers.py -h`` to see a list of the command line options.

Compile HOOMD-blue
------------------

Configure::

    ▶ cd /path/to/hoomd-blue
    ▶ cmake -B build
    ▶ cd build

.. warning::

    Make certain you point ``CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`` at your virtual environment so that CMake can find
    packages there and correctly determine the installation location.::

        ▶ export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/environment

By default, **HOOMD-blue** configures a *Release* optimized build type for a
generic CPU architecture and with no optional libraries. Pass these options to cmake
to enable optimizations specific to your CPU::

    -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=-march=native -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS=-march=native

Set ``-DENABLE_GPU=ON`` to compile for the GPU and ``-DENABLE_MPI=ON`` to enable parallel simulations with MPI.
See the build options section below for a full list of options.

Compile::

    ▶ make -j4

Test your build (requires a GPU to pass if **HOOMD-blue** was built with HIP support)::

    ▶ ctest

.. attention::

    On a cluster, run ``ctest`` within a job on a GPU compute node.

To install **HOOMD-blue** into your Python environment, run::

    ▶ make install

Build options
-------------

To change HOOMD build options, navigate to the ``build`` directory and run::

    ▶ ccmake .

After changing an option, press ``c`` to configure, then press ``g`` to
generate. The ``Makefile`` is now updated with the newly selected
options. You can also set these parameters on the command line with
``cmake``::

    ▶ cmake . -DENABLE_GPU=ON

Options that specify library versions only take effect on a clean invocation of
CMake. To set these options, first remove ``CMakeCache.txt`` and then run ``cmake``
and specify these options on the command line:

- ``PYTHON_EXECUTABLE`` - Specify which ``python`` to build against. Example: ``/usr/bin/python3``.

  - Default: ``python3.X`` detected on ``$PATH``

- ``CMAKE_CUDA_COMPILER`` - Specify which ``nvcc`` or ``hipcc`` to build with.

  - Default: location of ``nvcc`` detected on ``$PATH``

- ``MPI_HOME`` (env var) - Specify the location where MPI is installed.

  - Default: location of ``mpicc`` detected on the ``$PATH``

Other option changes take effect at any time. These can be set from within
``ccmake`` or on the command line:

- ``BUILD_HPMC`` - Enables building the ``hoomd.hpmc`` module.
- ``BUILD_MD`` - Enables building the ``hoomd.md`` module.
- ``BUILD_METAL`` - Enables building the ``hoomd.metal`` module.
- ``BUILD_TESTING`` - Enables the compilation of unit tests.
- ``CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`` - Sets the build type (case sensitive) Options:

  - ``Debug`` - Compiles debug information into the library and executables.
    Enables asserts to check for programming mistakes. HOOMD-blue will run
    slow when compiled in Debug mode, but problems are easier to identify.
  - ``RelWithDebInfo`` - Compiles with optimizations and debug symbols.
    Useful for profiling benchmarks.
  - ``Release`` - (default) All compiler optimizations are enabled and
    asserts are removed. Recommended for production builds: required for any
    benchmarking.

- ``ENABLE_GPU`` - Enable compiling of the GPU accelerated computations. Default: ``OFF``.
- ``ENABLE_DOXYGEN`` - Enables the generation of developer documentation
  Default: ``OFF``.
- ``SINGLE_PRECISION`` - Controls precision. Default: ``OFF``.

  - When set to ``ON``, all calculations are performed in single precision.
  - When set to ``OFF``, all calculations are performed in double precision.

- ``ENABLE_HPMC_MIXED_PRECISION`` - Controls mixed precision in the hpmc
  component. When on, single precision is forced in expensive shape overlap
  checks.
- ``ENABLE_MPI`` - Enable multi-processor/GPU simulations using MPI.

  - When set to ``ON``, multi-processor/multi-GPU simulations are supported.
  - When set to ``OFF`` (the default), always run in single-processor/single-GPU mode.

- ``ENABLE_MPI_CUDA`` - Enable CUDA-aware MPI library support.

  - Requires a MPI library with CUDA support to be installed.
  - When set to ``ON`` (default if a CUDA-aware MPI library is detected),
    **HOOMD-blue** will make use of the capability of the MPI library to
    accelerate CUDA-buffer transfers.
  - When set to ``OFF``, standard MPI calls will be used.
  - *Warning:* Manually setting this feature to ``ON`` when the MPI library
    does not support CUDA may cause **HOOMD-blue** to crash.

- ``ENABLE_TBB`` - Enable support for Intel's Threading Building Blocks (TBB).

  - Requires TBB to be installed.
  - When set to ``ON``, HOOMD will use TBB to speed up calculations in some
    classes on multiple CPU cores.

These options control CUDA compilation via ``nvcc``:

- ``CUDA_ARCH_LIST`` - A semicolon-separated list of GPU architectures to
  compile in.
