r"""Neighbor list acceleration structures.

Pair forces (`hoomd.md.pair`) use neighbor list data structures to find
neighboring particle pairs (those within a distance of :math:`r_\mathrm{cut}`)
efficiently. HOOMD-blue provides a several types of neighbor list construction
algorithms that you can select from: `Cell`, `Tree`, and `Stencil`.

Multiple pair force objects can share a single neighbor list, or use independent
neighbor list objects. When neighbor lists are shared, they find neighbors
within the the maximum :math:`r_{\mathrm{cut},i,j}` over the associated pair
potentials.

.. rubric:: Buffer distance

Set the `NeighborList.buffer` distance to amortize the cost of the neighbor list
build. When ``buffer > 0``, a neighbor list computed on one step can be reused
on subsequent steps until a particle moves a distance ``buffer/2``. When
`NeighborList.check_dist` is `True`, `NeighborList` starts checking how far
particles have moved `NeighborList.rebuild_check_delay` time steps after the
last build and performs a rebuild when any particle has moved a distance
``buffer/2``. When `NeighborList.check_dist` is `False`, `NeighborList` always
rebuilds after `NeighborList.rebuild_check_delay` time steps.

Note:
    With the default settings (``check_dist=True`` and
    ``rebuild_check_delay=1``), changing `NeighborList.buffer` only impacts
    simulation performance and not correctness.

    Set the buffer too small and the neighbor list will need to be updated
    often, slowing simulation performance. Set the buffer too large, and
    `hoomd.md.pair.Pair` will need to needlessly calculate many non-interacting
    particle pairs and slow the simulation. There is an optimal value for
    `NeighborList.buffer` between the two extremes that provides the best
    performance.

.. rubric:: Base distance cutoff

The `NeighborList.r_cut` attribute can be used to set the base cutoff distance
for neighbor list queries. The actual cutoff distance is always the maximum
:math:`r_{\mathrm{cut},i,j}` of the base cutoff and associated pair potentials.

Note:
    This attribute is particularly useful for implementing custom pair forces in
    Python.

Attention:
    Users should only set this attribute when utilizing the accessor APIs,
    `pair_list`, `local_pair_list`, `cpu_local_nlist_arrays`, or
    `gpu_local_nlist_arrays`.

.. rubric:: Exclusions

Neighbor lists nominally include all particles within the chosen cutoff
distances. The `NeighborList.exclusions` attribute defines which particles will
be excluded from the list, even if they are within the cutoff.
`NeighborList.exclusions` is a tuple of strings that enable one more more types
of exclusions. The valid exclusion types are:

* ``'angle'``: Exclude the first and third particles in each angle.
* ``'body'``: Exclude particles that belong to the same rigid body.
* ``'bond'``: Exclude particles that are directly bonded together.
* ``'meshbond'``: Exclude particles that are bonded together via a mesh.
* ``'constraint'``: Exclude particles that have a distance constraint applied
  between them.
* ``'dihedral'``: Exclude the first and fourth particles in each dihedral.
* ``'special_pair'``: Exclude particles that are part of a special pair.
* ``'1-3'``: Exclude particles *i* and *k* whenever there is a bond (i,j) and
  a bond (j,k).
* ``'1-4'``: Exclude particles *i* and *m* whenever there are bonds (i,j),
  (j,k), and (k,m).

    `Cell` finds neighboring particles using a fixed width cell list, allowing
    for *O(kN)* construction of the neighbor list where *k* is the number of
    particles per cell. Cells are sized to the largest :math:`r_\mathrm{cut}`.
    This method is very efficient for systems with nearly monodisperse cutoffs,
    but performance degrades for large cutoff radius asymmetries due to the
    significantly increased number of particles per cell. In practice, `Cell`
    is usually the best option for most users when the asymmetry between the
    largest and smallest cutoff radius is less than 2:1.

    Note:
        `Cell` may consume a significant amount of memory, especially on GPU
        devices. One cause of this can be non-uniform density distributions
        because the memory allocated for the cell list is proportional the
        maximum number of particles in any cell. Another common cause is large
        box volumes combined with small cutoffs, which results in a very large
        number of cells in the system. In these cases, consider using `Stencil`
        or `Tree`, which can use less memory.

    `Stencil` finds neighboring particles using a fixed width cell list, for
    *O(kN)* construction of the neighbor list where *k* is the number of
    particles per cell. In contrast with `Cell`, `Stencil` allows the user to
    choose the cell width: `cell_width` instead of fixing it to the largest
    cutoff radius (`P.J. in't Veld et al. 2008
    <http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cpc.2008.03.005>`_):

    .. image:: stencil_schematic.png
        :width: 300 px
        :align: center
        :alt: Stenciled cell list schematic

    This neighbor list style differs from `Cell` in how the adjacent cells are
    searched for particles. One stencil is computed per particle type based on
    the value of `cell_width` set by the user, which defines the bins that the
    particle must search in. Distances to the bins in the stencil are
    precomputed so that certain particles can be quickly excluded from the
    neighbor list, leading to improved performance compared to `Cell` when there
    is size disparity in the cutoff radius. The memory demands of `Stencil` can
    also be lower than `Cell` if your system is large and has many small cells
    in it; however, `Tree` is usually a better choice for these systems.

    The performance of `Stencil` depends strongly on the choice of *cell_width*.
    The best performance is obtained when the cutoff radii are multiples of the
    *cell_width*, and when the *cell_width* covers the simulation box with a
    roughly integer number of cells.

        nl_s = nlist.Stencil(cell_width=1.5)

class Tree(NeighborList):
    """Bounding volume hierarchy based neighbor list.

    Args:
        buffer (float): Buffer width :math:`[\\mathrm{length}]`.
        exclusions (tuple[str]): Defines which particles to exclude from the
            neighbor list, see more details in `NeighborList`.
        rebuild_check_delay (int): How often to attempt to rebuild the neighbor
            list.
        check_dist (bool): Flag to enable / disable distance checking.
        mesh (Mesh): When a mesh object is passed, the neighbor list uses the
            mesh to determine the bond exclusions in addition to all other
            set exclusions.

    `Tree` creates a neighbor list using a bounding volume hierarchy (BVH) tree
    traversal in :math:`O(N \\log N)` time. A BVH tree of axis-aligned bounding
    boxes is constructed per particle type, and each particle queries each tree
    to determine its neighbors. This method of searching leads to significantly
    improved performance compared to cell lists in systems with moderate size
    asymmetry, but has slower performance for monodisperse systems. `Tree` can
    also be slower than `Cell` if there are multiple types in the system, but
    the cutoffs between types are identical. (This is because one BVH is created
    per type.) The user should carefully benchmark neighbor list build times to
    select the appropriate neighbor list construction type.

    `Tree`'s memory requirements scale with the number of particles in the
    system rather than the box volume, which may be particularly advantageous
    for large, sparse systems.
